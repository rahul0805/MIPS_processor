# MIPS_processor
32 bit 2 stage pipelined MIPS processor.

There are 3 important stages in MIPS processor Fetch ,Decode and Execute. Detailed explination about the things are there in the folder lecture_slides.

The main components of implemented in this project are:
  1.Arithemetic Logic Unit
  2.Decoder
  3.Execute Stage design
  4.Memory Unit
  
  This project is done in in verilog using the software XILINX ISE.
